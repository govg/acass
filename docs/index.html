<li><p>Quiz 1 is up. Please find it <a href="goo.gl/I8Am3e">here</a>. It consists of a few short answer questions, mostly the true or false kind. It is automatically graded, and should also give you hints as to why your answer is wrong. Please let me know if you have any difficulties with the quiz.</p></li>
<li><p>Programming Assignment 1 is up. Please find it in the “Code” tabe to the top right. It is meant only as an introduction to scikit-learn and the IPython notebook environment.</p></li>
