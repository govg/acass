This will be an intro post, just to get your system up and running. 

For this, the prereqs are: 
- A working Docker installation
- Access to internet (or a local copy of the course Docker image)


We will mainly be working in Python. To get started, 

``` python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def test():
	print ("Test")
x = np.ndarray((10,1))

```
