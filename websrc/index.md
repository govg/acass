### Before the course

- Brush up on probability basics. What are independent events? What is the Bayes
	theorem? What are the basic probability distributions?
- Brush up on linear algebra. What's a matrix? What are vectors? 
- Gain access to a computer. Either a personal laptop, or desktops provided by 
 the department. Or find a partner who has a laptop and brings it to class!
