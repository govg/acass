### Announcements and links

- [Post course feedback](http://goo.gl/eR09vK) : Please fill this extremely short survey if you were
 part of my class. It would help in improving the offering of this course in the future, as well as
 provide me with feedback. 

- Programming tutorials for (PCA, SVM with Kernels, Adaboost) are all up. Please find them from the
 code tab to your top right.

- Some students have mentioned the difficulty in downloading Anaconda. I have hosted a local copy
 [here](http://web.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/govindg/temp/). Please install the relevant package for 
 your architecture. 

- Programming Assignment 2 is up. Please find it in the "Code" tabe to the top right. It is
	meant as an introduction to gradient descent and loss functions. Please let me know if there
	are any errors in the code, since I can't claim to be an expert at coding.

- Quiz 1 is up. Please find it [here](http://www.goo.gl/I8Am3e). It consists of a few short answer questions, 
 mostly the true or false kind. It is automatically graded, and should also give you hints as to
 why your answer is wrong. Please let me know if you have any difficulties with the quiz.

- Programming Assignment 1 is up. Please find it in the "Code" tabe to the top right. It is
 meant only as an introduction to scikit-learn and the IPython notebook environment. 

- [Pre-course survey](http://www.goo.gl/2hZlzo) - Please fill up this form, it lets me send
you course emails directly, and also adjust the course contents according to 
student demographic.

- [Permanent Feedback](http://www.goo.gl/6o9sC8) - Please let me know of any complaints / feedback you may
have about the course (method of delivery, matter delivered). You can choose to
identify yourself if you wish.
