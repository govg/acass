Below are some resources I feel naturally complement or extend the scope of
this lecture series. Please feel free to go through them, and suggest some more 
if you want!

### General Material
Reference courses : 

 - [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - One of the most famous MOOCs
around, available for free on Coursera.
 - [Machine learning Techniques](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/courses/ml_autumn16/ML.html) - 
Course at IIT Kanpur, at the level of junior undergraduates / graduates



### Textbooks

- [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - free pdf 
copy available online. 


### Topical material

- [Linear Algebra Overview](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf)
- [Probability Overview](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf)
- [Matrix Algebra Overview](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf)


### Programming resources 

- [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/) hosts machine learning contests. There are some that are just for practice,
 and are a good way to build intuition about models, as well as understand how to clean up and actually
 apply models to real life data. Some contests also have prize money, so participation can be for more
 than just knowledge.

- [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) Hosts a myriad array of different kinds of datasets.
 Also included are details of what the data is like, what benchmarks consider them, and what methods perform
 well. Good place to practice your data cleaning and modelling skills.

Other resources shall be put up later.
