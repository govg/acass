Below are some resources I feel naturally complement or extend the scope of
this lecture series. Please feel free to go through them, and suggest some more 
if you want!

### General Material
Reference courses : 

 - [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - One of the most famous MOOCs
around, available for free on Coursera.
 - [Machine learning Techniques](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/courses/ml_autumn16/ML.html) - 
Course at IIT Kanpur, at the level of junior undergraduates / graduates



## Theoretical Resources

### Textbooks

- [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - free pdf 
copy available online. 


### Topical material

- [Linear Algebra Overview](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf)
- [Probability Overview](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf)
- [Matrix Algebra Overview](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf)




## Programming resources 

### Data resources
- [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) Hosts a myriad array of different kinds of datasets.
 Also included are details of what the data is like, what benchmarks consider them, and what methods perform
 well. Good place to practice your data cleaning and modelling skills. 

- [Computer Vision datasets](http://clickdamage.com/sourcecode/cv_datasets.php) Hosts a wide variety of 
video and image datasets.

- [USA Government Data](http://clickdamage.com/sourcecode/cv_datasets.php) Hosts a variety of USA specific
data that has been collected by the government.

- [Aggregator](https://datahub.io/) Search engine for different kinds of data.

- [EU Data portal](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data) European Union collected datasets.


- [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/) hosts machine learning contests. There are some that are just for practice,
 and are a good way to build intuition about models, as well as understand how to clean up and actually
 apply models to real life data. Some contests also have prize money, so participation can be for more
 than just knowledge.

### Example IPython Notebooks

- [Iris](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)
- [Digit Recognition](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-digits-classification-py)
- [Comparison of Classifiers](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-classifier-comparison-py)
- [Digit showing](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-datasets-plot-digits-last-image-py)

Some more examples can be found in the course repository [here](https://github.com/govg/acass/tree/master/code/examples). A lot more can be found from Scikit Learn's documentation.


### Other resources

- [Neural network playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/) : lets you create toy neural networks
to see the power, on different kinds of datasets. This is an amazing tool to understand how neural networks possibly work, and on the toy datasets, it is easy to see the combination of perceptrons learning together!

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://try.jupyter.org/) : lets you create online jupyter notebooks. You can 
 try out the majority of tutorials I have posted using this tool.

Other resources shall be put up later.
